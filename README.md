# Advanced Email Triage System - OpenEnv Environment

Advanced Email Triage is a production-grade OpenEnv-compatible environment for training and evaluating agents on a real enterprise workflow: inbox triage under routing, SLA pressure, spam, sentiment, ownership, escalation, and human-review constraints.

## Why this environment matters

Enterprise teams triage inbound email every day across support, finance, security, legal, operations, and sales. This environment turns that real workflow into a learnable agent setting rather than a toy benchmark.

Agents must:

- classify inbound emails
- assign priority and urgency
- route to the correct department
- detect spam
- estimate customer sentiment
- draft operational responses
- assign named ownership
- choose a realistic resolution ETA
- request human review on risky turns
- escalate without over-escalating
- operate under queue pressure and reviewer backlog
- handle multi-turn threaded inbox conversations

This makes the hard task meaningfully closer to how enterprise triage really works: decisions are not just labels, they are commitments.

## OpenEnv contract

The environment exposes the standard interaction surface:

- `POST /reset`
- `POST /step`
- `GET /state`

It also includes validator-facing endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /metadata`
- `GET /schema`
- `POST /mcp`

The root configuration file is [openenv.yaml](./openenv.yaml).

## Typed spaces

### Observation

The typed observation model is `TriageObservation` in [backend/schemas/env.py](./backend/schemas/env.py).

Core observation fields:

- `environment_id`
- `episode_id`
- `task_id`
- `difficulty`
- `step_count`
- `max_steps`
- `current_turn`
- `turn_label`
- `email`
- `thread_messages`
- `pending_actions`
- `sla_status`
- `escalation_level`
- `human_review_required`
- `queue_depth`
- `pending_sla_breaches`
- `reviewer_backlog`
- `customer_history_summary`
- `business_impact`
- `suggested_departments`
- `ownership_status`
- `done`
- `history_length`
- `completion_score`

These extra operational fields make the environment substantially less toy-like: agents must reason about business context and queue conditions, not just a single email body.

### Action

The typed action model is `AgentAction` in [backend/schemas/env.py](./backend/schemas/env.py).

Action fields:

- `category`
- `priority`
- `department`
- `spam`
- `sentiment`
- `urgency`
- `response_draft`
- `escalation`
- `confidence`
- `internal_note`
- `request_human_review`
- `assigned_owner`
- `resolution_eta_hours`
- `customer_follow_up_required`
- `escalation_target`

### Reward

The typed reward model is `RewardSignal` in [backend/schemas/env.py](./backend/schemas/env.py).

Reward fields:

- `score` in `0.0-1.0`
- `score_breakdown`
- `matched`
- `mistakes`
- `partial_progress`
- `penalty_flags`

## Tasks

### Task 1 - Easy

`task-email-classification-easy`

Objective: predict the correct business category for a single inbound email.

Expected difficulty: easy. This isolates the core classification problem.

### Task 2 - Medium

`task-triage-medium`

Objective: classify the email, assign priority, and route it to the correct department while respecting SLA urgency.

Expected difficulty: medium. This introduces cross-field dependencies and routing logic.

### Task 3 - Hard

`task-full-enterprise-hard`

Objective: handle full enterprise triage including spam, urgency, sentiment, SLA pressure, escalation, named ownership, ETA planning, reviewer handoff, and queue-aware decision making.

Expected difficulty: hard. This is the benchmark task intended to challenge stronger frontier agents.

## Graders and reward shaping

Task grading is deterministic and normalized to `0.0-1.0` in [graders/email_grader.py](./graders/email_grader.py).

The grader provides dense reward instead of a sparse final-only signal. It evaluates:

- required task outputs
- SLA-aware priority decisions
- spam guardrails
- response quality on hard turns
- reviewer escalation behavior
- confidence calibration
- internal notes for advanced triage
- ownership assignment
- ETA realism under SLA constraints
- customer follow-up commitment
- escalation target discipline, including over-escalation penalties

This gives agents useful partial-credit signals throughout the trajectory while still enforcing realistic mistakes.

## Environment mechanics

The environment runtime is in [backend/services/env_service.py](./backend/services/env_service.py).

Notable mechanics:

- clean `reset()` state for every episode
- deterministic task sampling from the synthetic dataset
- multi-turn customer follow-ups on hard tasks
- executive escalation turns for high-risk accounts
- queue backlog, reviewer load, and business impact context
- ownership state transitions across turns
- reviewer feedback loop with reward deltas

## Architecture

### Backend

- FastAPI runtime in [backend/main.py](./backend/main.py)
- environment logic in [backend/services/env_service.py](./backend/services/env_service.py)
- baseline runner in [backend/services/baseline_service.py](./backend/services/baseline_service.py)
- SQLite persistence in [backend/db/sqlite.py](./backend/db/sqlite.py)
- OpenEnv entrypoint in [server/app.py](./server/app.py)

### Models and training

- synthetic dataset generator in [training/data_generator.py](./training/data_generator.py)
- training pipeline in [train.py](./train.py)
- local inference engine in [backend/services/inference_engine.py](./backend/services/inference_engine.py)
- saved evaluation metrics in `models/metrics.json`

### Frontend

- React + TypeScript + Tailwind dashboard in [ui](./ui)
- Zustand state management
- Recharts analytics
- inbox, decision, reviewer, and analytics panels

## Dataset

The synthetic enterprise dataset contains at least 5000 rows and includes:

- `email_text`
- `category`
- `priority`
- `department`
- `sentiment`
- `spam`
- `urgency`

Additional realism fields include:

- `email_id`
- `thread_id`
- `subject`
- `customer_name`
- `customer_tier`
- `received_at`
- `sla_due_at`
- `escalation_required`
- `draft_response`

Generate or refresh the dataset with:

```bash
python -m training.data_generator
```

## Training

Train the local models:

```bash
python train.py --backend classical
```

Optional transformer fine-tuning path:

```bash
python train.py --backend transformer --epochs 1 --batch-size 8
```

Outputs are written under [models](./models).

## Running the environment

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the app:

```bash
python run.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The API is then available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Dashboard

For local frontend development:

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

If the frontend runs separately, set:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Evaluation Pipeline (Hugging Face Router)

The submission-facing evaluation script is `inference.py`. This script is designed for the **OpenEnv RL Challenge** and uses the OpenAI client to interact with the Hugging Face Router.

### Required Environment Variables

To run the evaluation, you must set the following environment variables:
* `HF_TOKEN=<your_hugging_face_token>` (**Mandatory**)
* `API_BASE_URL=https://router.huggingface.co/v1` (Optional default)
* `MODEL_NAME=meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` (Optional default)

### Run the Evaluation

```bash
python inference.py --task-id task-email-classification-easy --max-steps 5 --seed 42
```

### Expected Output Format

The output strictly adheres to the OpenEnv RL Challenge `[START]`, `[STEP]`, and `[END]` logging format:

```text
[START] task=task-email-classification-easy env=advanced-email-triage model=meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
[STEP] step=1 action="category=human_resources,priority=medium,dept=people_ops" reward=1.00 done=true error=null
[END] success=true steps=1 rewards=1.00
```

## Local model prediction utility

For a single local heuristic or trained-model prediction without the external baseline runner:

```bash
python predict_email.py --email-text "Our payment portal shows an overdue balance even though we paid last week."
```

## Validation

OpenEnv validation should be run from the repository root:

```bash
python -m openenv.cli validate
```

A lightweight pre-submission helper is also included:

```bash
python prevalidate.py
```

## Docker

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t email-triage-openenv .
docker run -p 7860:7860 email-triage-openenv
```

The container launches the dataset bootstrap and the FastAPI server entrypoint in [server/app.py](./server/app.py).

## Hugging Face Spaces

This repository is prepared for Docker Spaces deployment.

Recommended Space variables:

- `API_BASE_URL`
- `MODEL_NAME`
- `HF_TOKEN`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `MODEL_BACKEND`

The root `Dockerfile` serves the environment and UI on the Space port.
